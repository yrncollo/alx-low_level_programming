## 0x1A-hash tables
- Use the following structs for your project
```
/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
 *
 * @key: The key, string
 * The key is unique in the HashTable
 * @value: The value corresponding to a key
 * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
 */
typedef struct hash_node_s
{
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash table data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
 */
typedef struct hash_table_s
{
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;

```
0. Write a function that creates a hash table.
1. Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm
2. Write a function that gives you the index of a key.
3. Write a function that adds an element to the hash table.
4. Write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key
5. Write a function that prints a hash table.
6. Write a function that deletes a hash table.
7. Before you continue, please take a moment to think about it: how you would implement it if you were asked to during an interview or a job. What data structures would you use? How would it work?
- For this task, please:
(a) Read PHP Internals Book: HashTable <br>
(b) Use the same hash function <br>
(c) Use these data structures: <br>

 * @sprev: A pointer to the previous element of the sorted linked list
